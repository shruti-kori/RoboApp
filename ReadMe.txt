This robo app takes care of initial prototype of the robo functionalities. The Robo currently can walk only 5km per charge
and uses extra 2% in case weight is added. Also Robo can carry a maximum weight of no more than 10kg. This app has test cases
to test the prototype.

Followed Factory design pattern to get all the services since the implementations are all interconnected.

To run this project just run the test cases.

Minimum requirement : Java requirement 1.8
